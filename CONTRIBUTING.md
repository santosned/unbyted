## Newcomers guide

Welcome ðŸ¤— see our [README](README.md) file to get an overview of the project. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Setting up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started

### Issues

Please don't file an issue to ask a question. You'll get faster results using the resources bellow:

- [Github Discussions, the official Unbyted message board](https://github.com/santosned/unbyted/discussions)

#### Create new issues

If you spot a problem within this project, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/santosned/unbyted/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue template](https://github.com/santosned/unbyted/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Search through our [open issues](https://github.com/santosned/unbyted/issues) to find one that interest you. Generally, no issue will be assign to anyone. If you find one, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make changes

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.

- Using Github Desktop:
  - [Getting started with Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!
- Using command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Install or update to **Node.js v18**. For more information, see the [Development Guide](docs/contributing/DEVELOPMENT.md).
3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Once you are satisfied with the modifications, commit them. Remember to conduct a **self-evaluation** to facilitate the review process.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- If you are resolving an issue, remember to link the PR to it.
- [Allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to be enabled so that the branch may be modified for a merging. After you submit your PR, the maintainer will examine it.
- We may ask questions or request additional information.
  We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. After you can make changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [Git Tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ and thank you for the effort!

Now you are part of our community âœ¨

[See how else you can contribute](docs/contributing/TYPES_OF_CONTRIBUTIONS.md).

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add" instead of "Added")
- Avoid long first line messages, keep at 72 characters or less
- Reference issues or pull requests after the first line
- When only change documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title. [See more about skipping workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/skipping-workflow-runs)

### Typescript code

- Avoid platform-dependent code
- Write clear and concise [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/) for functions
- Keep the names of objects, functions, or variables informative and brief so that no further documentation is required to understand them.
